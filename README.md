An easy dice game where a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to hold. If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
On the other hand,if the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn. The objective of the game is to score 100 points before the opponent(s) do(es).
